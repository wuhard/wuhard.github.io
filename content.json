The word “Internet bar” is not as hot as it used to be. But for some countries in the world, especially in Africa, what is the situation of Internet cafes? Now let’s have a look. The popularity of Internet cafes in Africa is very low Due to poverty and unrest in Africa, the popularity of Internet cafes is still relatively low, and most Africans can’t access computers. Potential Internet users in Africa don’t realize the significance of using the Internet. The environment of African Internet bar is very simple It is very difficult to find a luxurious Internet cafe in Africa. Most of the Internet bar facilities at there are simple, and the computer configuration is also very low. Most of these shops are simple in appearance. Painting on the wall is a kind of decoration. Some shops still have white lime walls, and the messy wires on the walls are clearly visible. Entering the Internet bar, it is basically a simple one table one chair for each customer. There is no trace of any spacious leather sofa, cool mouse and powerful host. African Internet bar price is very expensive. What is the price of Internet bar in most Asia countries? Generally, small counties and cities cost about 0.3 to 0.5 dollar per hour, and high-end Internet cafes cost about 1 dollar. However, in the case of simple environment and slow internet speed, African Internet cafes charge more than Asian ones. In Africa, Zimbabwe,the monthly network fee is almost 1200 dollar, which is not affordable for common families. So a lot of people want to go online only to choose Internet cafes. In general, Internet cafes in Africa cost about $2 an hour. The speed of Internet cafes in Africa is very slow The bandwidth of African Internet cafes is quite low. It takes five to six minutes to open a web page. The Internet experience here is very bad.Sometimes it may take a day to download a movie. Compared with the Internet speed of some developed countries, the Internet speed of African Internet cafes is like the speed of tortoises relative to rockets. What is the behavior of Internet cafe customers in Africa？ Unlike most asian people who mainly play games, watch movies and chat in Internet cafes, African Internet cafes are often used to print documents, edit documents, send and receive e-mails, and undertake the most basic “Internet surfing” function of the Internet. This is about the current situation of African Internet cafes. Although they are relatively backward now, I believe that in the near future, Africa can also have luxury environment and high-speed Internet cafes.","link":"/2020/04/25/AfricaInternetCafe/"},{"title":"Introdution of Central African Republic","text":"Introdution of Central African RepublicSummaryIt is located in the central African continent, a landlocked country, bordering Sudan in the east, Congo (Brazzaville) and Congo (Kinshasa) in the south, Cameroon in the west and Chad in the north.
